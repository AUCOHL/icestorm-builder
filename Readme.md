# Cloud V Icestorm Builder
This repo, maintained by [@donn](https://github.com/donn) builds binaries for the FPGA Icestorm for Cloud V.

That is because if I had to rebuild these every single time I wanted to deploy Cloud V I would go insane.

# What is going on inside /Resources?
Resources has a failed attempt to create a distro-independent binary or an AppImage of some kind.

I'm gonna keep it because it's a neat experiment but it's not working and I stopped caring when it hit 5 AM.
